Reactive programming is an approach to writing software that embraces asynchronous IO. Asynchronous I/O is a small idea that portends big changes for software. The idea is simple: alleviate inefficient resource utilization by reclaiming resources that would otherwise be idle as they waited for I/O activity. Asynchronous IO inverts the normal design of IO processing: the clients are notified of new data instead of asking for it; this frees the client to do other things while waiting for new notifications. Let's look at an example that compares and contrasts asynchronous IO to synchronous IO.

Let's build a simple program that reads data from a source (a `java.io.File` reference, specifically). First up, an implementation that uses a trusty 'ol `java.io.InputStream` implementation:

.Read data from a file _synchronously_

package com.example.io;

import lombok.extern.log4j.Log4j2;
import org.springframework.util.FileCopyUtils;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

@Log4j2
class Synchronous implements Reader {

    @Override
    public void read(File file, Consumer<BytesPayload> consumer) throws IOException {
        try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(file)) { // <1>
            byte[] data = new byte[FileCopyUtils.BUFFER_SIZE];
            int res;
            while ((res = in.read(data, 0, data.length)) != -1) { // <2>
                    consumer.accept(BytesPayload.from(data, res)); //<3>
            }
        }
    }
}

<1> source the file using a regular `java.io.File`
<2> _pull_ the results out of the source one line at a time..
<3> I've written this code to accept a `Consumer<BytesPayload>` that gets called when there's new data
